Add a launcher helper. It provides a mechanism to launch remote scripts in a
bash environment.
Rename daily scripts to differential which is a more accurate description.
Convert all at scripts to use bash.
The scripts now look to a <Script_Name>.d sub-directory to perform a run-parts
on. User provided scripts may be placed here to run before or after the script
of the same root name.
